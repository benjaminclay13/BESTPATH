        <p class="instructions2">God will lead me!</p>
        <p>I need God’s Holy Spirit to reveal His vision and individual mission for my life. God speaks to us using the Holy Spirit through our reading and hearing teachings on the Bible, prayer with Him, circumstances in our lives, the church (the body of other believers in Christ), and the words and actions of others in our lives to reveal Himself, His purposes, and His ways. These things need to be revealed to us before we can consider whether we are even pursuing the right things in our lives or whether we are just wasting our time. It may be that our next job offer (from a worldly perspective) is totally wrong as a career choice; however, from His perspective, it may be the perfect “tent-making” opportunity to equip us for His next assignment in our lives. We should willingly accept any job that is clearly from God’s hand. We should also recognize that all jobs are temporary (temporal) and the “job assignment search” (seeking and following God’s will) is continuous (eternal). Our ultimate loyalty must always be to the Father and not to any job, company, or career path.</p>
        <p>The ultimate purpose of our work and career path will always be connected in some way to understanding and being more like Christ, bringing all glory to the Father, and making disciples for Christ in the power of the Holy Spirit.</p>
        <p><i>“For by grace you have been saved through faith; and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them.”</i> <b>(Ephesians 2:8-10 NASB)</b></p>
        <p>Let us begin this spiritual journey together with Him, do all that we can, and then trust Him fully for the results!</p>

        <p>The following has been paraphrased from <i>The Seven Seasons of the Man in the Mirror</i> by Patrick Morley:</p>
        <p class="instructions2">How to be successful in the Lord:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Depend on God’s resources, not just your own. – Courage is not the absence of fear, but instead, a willingness to trust God anyways in the presence of fear.</li>
            <br />
            <li>Do everything you do in the name of the Lord! – So closely identify everything you do with God, so that before men can prevail against you, they must first prevail against God Himself.</li>
            <br />
            <li>Take personal responsibility for your own life! – Aggressively follow-up with whatever God reveals for you to do, and be thankful for whatever God decides that you should do, and whatever the resulting outcome.</li>
            <br />
            <li>God is not calling you to be successful; instead, He is calling for you to be faithful to Him!</li>
            <br />
            <li>Fix your eyes on Jesus, run your race with perseverance, and do not grow weary or lose heart!</li>
            <br />
            <li>Take risks, depend on God, take personal responsibility for your actions, and expect opposition. – The great secret of contentment is not getting what you want, but instead, wanting what you get.</li>
            <br />
            <li>No amount of success at work will compensate for failure at home. True success is to satisfy God’s calling for our lives, not our ambitions!</li>
            <br />
            <li><b>A truly successful person is one of courage, wisdom, commitment, and balance! (Morley, 1995)</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p><b><u>Reference:</u></b></p>
